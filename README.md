# Time-Traveler-s-Toolkit

## Purpose

  The purpose of this project was to familairaize myself with the datetime, random, and building a custom module for import. 
  
  The project itself was intended to functino as a time traveler's script. The user eners in a few needed inputs, year they want to visit, destination, and such. Then a calculation for the cost is done to let the use know the cost for travel. 


## Improvements

  What I would improve on the next iteration is adding in a currency converter, longer destination list or destination as a user input. The user's current destination so travel distance can also be calculated in.
